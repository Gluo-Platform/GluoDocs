# GluoDocs

Official developer API documentation for the Gluo API.

**What is `v4`?**  

It is a new, faster and more features bringing API. This new API will run the official web app and potentially later official client apps (mobile, desktop) or even unofficial developer apps. We aim to make it easier to use for our own but also external developers.

**How will `v4` work for developing users?**

- A developer-friendly API that allows any developer to create and make use of our features. To ensure fair, fun and social use of this API we will be bringing a set of features and requirements.
- A developer program that will grant small features to those that the platform identifies as developers. As of now, we are not entirely sure how this will manifest itself.
- As an automatic integration with the platform, we will be bringing Gluo Bots. These bots will not be granted access to posts or comments in the public application. To use a bot you will have to invite it to a private or public group. This is to ensure that bots will not dominate communal and public spaces without the owners' consent.
