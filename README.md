# GluoDocs
Official developer API documentation for the Gluo API.
  
**When will the `x`  characters leave?**
Currently `v3` is the API used by all Gluo services. Because it wasn't designed with public usage in mind, there is need for a rewrite, `v4`. This rewrite will take public developer usage in account, run faster, better and more consistently documented.
