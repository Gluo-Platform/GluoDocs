# GluoDocs
Official developer API documentation for the Gluo API.
  
Obvious issue as of now is that urls consist out of `x` characters. That is intentional and we know that it makes the API unusable. It is a temporary messure till the api is actually finished. By doing so we allow you to already explore the API while you won't encounter issues that can occur with unfinished endpoints.  
  
Before we can release the API to the public we want to really allow our developers to shine. To allow for that we are working on a feature that can be described as "Bot accounts" [what are bot accounts](/docs/core/bot_accounts.md). So when is this feature planned?  
The people that already went and had a look at bot accounts will know that bots wont operate on the public topics. Public topics are topics anyone could have access to by just logging in.  
It is a precaution as we can't have botted accounts roaming around on the public pages.  
So the solution lays within anohter planned update. The **Gluo Groups** update is a long awaited project that is currently being worked on.  
What will it bring? 
- Private and public groups which have their own, independent topics. 
- A simple permission system allowing people to manage these small communities to their liking. 
- Bot accounts will be able to, upon accaptance by someone with the right [permissions](/docs/core/permissions.md#group-permissions), perform any of the actions documented in these docs. 

**So when will groups be a thing, when will the annpying `x` characters leave?**    
Even for us it is still a mystery when such a large undertaking will be finished. The aim is to release groups in the first half of 2023, although learning from previous experiences we aren't promissing anything.  
One thing I am willing to boldly state is that we will manage to pull it off before the end of 2023 ðŸ˜Ž.  
We truly hope we will see you once the time for Gluo Developers has come.
